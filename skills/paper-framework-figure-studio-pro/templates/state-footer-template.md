# State Footer Template v3.2.15b

全流程：S0-PAPER-FOUNDATION -> S1-FIGURE-STRATEGY -> S2-SKETCH-EXPLORE -> S3-DIRECTION-SELECT -> S4-CANDIDATE-BRIEF -> S5-CANDIDATE-IMAGE -> END

当前 step：`<CURRENT_STEP>`
默认下一步：`<DEFAULT_NEXT_STEP_OR_NONE>`

Every text step response must state the exact current public step ID, state that the public step has ended, state that the next public step has not been executed, and provide only the next copyable prompt. S2 and S5 are image-generation-only stages and do not contain text review, candidate-level revision, review, or aggregate substages.

After S5, do not provide a next workflow prompt. Use this terminal line:

```text
我的任务已经完成，剩下由人类来决策。
```
