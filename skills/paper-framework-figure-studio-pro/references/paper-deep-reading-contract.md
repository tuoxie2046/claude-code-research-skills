# Paper Deep Reading Contract

After S5, human decisions are outside this assistant workflow.

When the input includes a PDF, LaTeX source, full paper text, detailed method description, report, supplement, or equivalent material, S0 must produce a rich, accurate, source-grounded `paper-foundation-report.md`.

The report should include:

- problem, assumptions, and related-work gap;
- ordered method or algorithm steps;
- model architecture, components, modules, training flow, inference flow, and inputs/outputs;
- losses, objectives, equations, constraints, and terminology mapping;
- abbreviation integrity: for every paper-defined acronym, single-letter role, dataset/group symbol, module shorthand, or overloaded term, record its source-defined expansion, semantic scope, visual-safe label, ambiguity risk, and forbidden expansions that would contradict the paper;
- artifact lineage: when any paper artifact, generated data pool, sample set, memory, retrieval result, pseudo-label set, prototype bank, score, weight, teacher signal, validation proxy, reward, or intermediate representation feeds more than one downstream path, record an `artifact_lineage_table` with producer, consumer paths, lineage relation, visual encoding rule, forbidden visual inference, and evidence anchor;
- arrow semantics: source, target, meaning, and evidence anchor;
- figure-relevant inclusions, exclusions, uncertainty, and reviewer risk;
- framework-figure readiness issues that could require author supplementation, including missing core relations, unsupported lineage, contradictory terminology, opaque core-module internals, or complete-framework scope mismatch;
- core innovation modules and non-droppable core substeps.

S0 owns author supplementation. If the source material is too incomplete, ambiguous, or contradictory for the requested framework figure, S0 must write `outputs/S0-paper-foundation/author-supplement-request.md` and set `s0_foundation_readiness_state.foundation_readiness_status` to `S0_NEEDS_AUTHOR_SUPPLEMENT` or `S0_NOT_SUITABLE_FOR_COMPLETE_FRAMEWORK`. If the user provides additional information, S0 must update `paper-foundation-report.md`, write `outputs/S0-paper-foundation/supplement-integration-log.md`, and revise the readiness state before S1 runs. If the user declines supplementation or chooses to proceed anyway, S0 must record `proceed_with_known_risks=true` and preserve unresolved items in `outputs/S0-paper-foundation/framework-figure-risk-register.md`.

After S5, human decisions are outside this assistant workflow.

S1-FIGURE-STRATEGY must not perform a new source-sufficiency judgment. If S1 discovers that the S0 foundation is missing, stale, or internally inconsistent, it must stop and point to an explicit S0 rerun instead of asking author-supplement questions inside S1.
